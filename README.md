# MARADJS

This paper aims to elaborate the MARADJS (Machine Learning Repository Applied to Dynamic JavaScript Files Analysis), a database that allows the classification of .js files between malicious and benign. MARADJS consists of 990 JavaScript files malware and 990 other benign JavaScript files. The MARADJS database, therefore, is suitable for learning with machine learning, considering that the js files presented the same amount in the different classes (benign and malwares). The aim is that biased classifiers, in relation to a certain class, do not have their favoring rates favored.
In relation to virtual pests, MARADJS extracted malicious JavaScript files from Github which is a repository of malware samples to provide security researchers, incident responders, forensic analysts, and the morbidly curious access to samples of live malicious code. With regard to benign js files, the catalog was given from the application repository JQuery Plugin Registry. It is emphasized that all benign files have been audited by VirusTotal. Therefore, benign js files, contained in MARADJS, have had their benevolence attested by the world's leading commercial antivirus. 
Therefore, MARADJS freely makes available all its benign and malware samples:

•	extension files js,
•	Virustotal audits,
•	Dynamic analysis of the Cuckoo Sandbox.
